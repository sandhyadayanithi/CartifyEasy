# 🛒 CartifyEasy

*Because grocery shopping should be as chill as a cat munching popcorn* 🐱🍿

## What's This All About?

CartifyEasy is your no-nonsense shopping list app that actually gets out of your way. Type what you need, tap to add, double-tap to yeet it off the list. That's it. No accounts, no premium tiers, no "rate us!" popups—just you, your cart, and a vibing cat GIF.

## ✨ The Goods

- **Brain-dead simple**: One input field. One button. Zero confusion.
- **Real-time sync**: Powered by Firebase, so your list updates faster than you can say "did we need milk?"
- **Double-tap delete**: Made a mistake? Just double-tap any item to banish it to the void
- **Peachy aesthetic**: Warm, cozy colors that won't burn your retinas at 2 AM
- **Cat energy**: Features a perpetually snacking cat because why not

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (you know the drill)
2. Make sure you have your own Firebase setup, or use mine if you're feeling adventurous
3. Open `index.html` in your browser
4. Start adding stuff to your cart like there's no tomorrow

## 🎮 How to Use

1. **Add items**: Type something in the box, hit "Add to cart"
2. **Remove items**: Double-tap/click any item when you've grabbed it
3. **Watch the cat**: Honestly, this is the main feature

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Vanilla JavaScript (because sometimes simple is better)
- Firebase Realtime Database (for that sweet, sweet sync)

- One (1) legendary cat GIF

## 💡 Pro Tips
